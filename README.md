# arbiter

This repo contains the Liz programming language source code and the Arbiter example used in the paper (TBD).

## Liz Snapshot

The Liz snapshot `liz_arbiter_snapshot.tar.gz` contains the source code to Liz and a folder named arbiter_examples. The Liz source code is a snapshot of the langauge as described in the paper (TDB). While the language syntax and feature set will remain frozen, this snapshot will be updated when bugs are discovered and as more compiler intrinsics are transformed into libraries.

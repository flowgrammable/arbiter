-- Quantified types



---- Existentially quantified data types ----
-- An existential type is one of the ways parametric types are implemented. Let
-- us consider the example of boxed types.
define exists (t:type). B: type = t
define b: B[|int|] = per 3

-- Like with all generative types, this type comes with two isomorphisms: `rep`
-- and `per`. Since the type is quantified, so are the isomorphisms.
rep (per 3) == 3
rep (per true) == true
rep (per 2.0) == 2.0
